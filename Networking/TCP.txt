On client side, connect()->sys_connect() invokes TCP_connect() which performs 3-way handshake with TCP_listen() of server. On success handshake, blocked sys_accept() will unblock and invoke TCP_accept() to create a new data socket and come out of accept() call. On failure handshake, sys_accept() will unblock and invok TCP_deny()
